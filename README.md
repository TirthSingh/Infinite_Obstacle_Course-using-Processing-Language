# Infinite_Runner
## Aim of this code: To make a platform game which continues infinitely 
### How it works:
There's a red block that you can control. Every time you press the space bar the block jumps. There are constant green obstacles which you have to avoid by jumping. Every time you avoid an obstacle a point is added to your score count displayed on the top left of the screen. For every 10 points you score the speed of the game will increase by 0.02% and it will increasingly become difficult to avoid them. Once you hit an obstacle the game is over and you have to press the "R" key on your keyboard to restart.
